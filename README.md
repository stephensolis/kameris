# modmap-toolkit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephensolis/modmap-toolkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephensolis/modmap-toolkit)

This is a fast and user-friendly generation and analysis pipeline for Molecular Distance Maps.

It uses:
- [stephensolis/modmap-generator-cpp](https://github.com/stephensolis/modmap-generator-cpp) to generate DNA sequence representations and distance matrices
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) for supervised classification experiments
- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and code based on [stephensolis/modmap-generator](https://github.com/stephensolis/modmap-generator) to generate interactive plots
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) for MultiDimensional Scaling (MDS)
